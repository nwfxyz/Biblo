This script aims to be able to convert multiple webpages to APA formats.

Current websites that provide this service still take multiple clicks to do so, I'm trying to reduce that to one click and produce it in a text format.


*  This project is still in the very early stages of development
*  I dont know how to tidy my github so.. This is also WIP.
